   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

This is your base documentation file. You can edit this file to add more context to your documentation. 
For example, you can add a brief description of your project, installation instructions, a quickstart guide, and more.

You can also add more pages to your documentation by creating new ``.rst`` files in the ``source`` directory and listing them in the ``toctree`` directive above, 
below the ``self`` entry. For example, if you create a new file called ``example.rst``, you can add it to the ``toctree`` directive like this:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 4

      self
